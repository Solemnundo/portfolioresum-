          <p>I am a young student with a deep passion for all things technical and mechanical. In highschool I focused my classes on computers as much as I could, I scored a 27 on my ACT and a Gold Level Certification on my Work Keys Exam. I am currently a student within the University of Wisconsin Full Stack Development Bootcamp. My current goals are to secure a job related to software development in order to gain valuable job experience for the roles while also expanding my own knowledge with everything I do. </p>
